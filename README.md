# DURST-VT4
It is a tap tempo pedal with which you can synchronize and start external MIDI devices, such as beat machines and other sequencers. Furthermore, external effect pedals with tap input can also be synchronized to the same speed. Mostly these are delay (DOD Rubberneck) or modulation pedals.
The pedal acts as a MIDI master clock.
